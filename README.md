# Introduction
Dedicated project on Forecasting Energy Consumption with US energy consumption data using Python's XGBoost machine learning algorithm for time series data to discover insights from and make prediction on energy consumption usage in the US.

Check the detailled analysis out here: [Forecasting_Energy_Consumption folder](/)

This machine learning project was created by [Rob Mulla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV12dGe_Fho).

# Background
Transitioning from a data analyst to a professional data scientist, this project helped me to upskill my skills in data analytics, feature engineering, and forecasting time series data using advanced machine learning algorithms.

Data is retrieved from [Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/deeplyft/timeseries-forecasting-with-xgboost/notebook).

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the development of machine learning model of the given time series data, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python** 
- **Jupyty Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **XGBoost**
- **TimeSeriesSplit**

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.

### 1. Pull & Clean Data
To clean and manipulate the unemployment rate data from the US job market, I filtered the monthly, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for all states. Then, I concatonated the different data by looping overy every state and removed non-relevant columns and NANs. To adjust the title column, I replaced some text and applied list comprehension to rename column names.

```python
# pull monthly, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for all states in percent
unemp_df = fred.search('unemployment rate state', filter=('frequency','Monthly'))
unemp_df = unemp_df.query('seasonal_adjustment == "Seasonally Adjusted" and units == "Percent"')
unemp_df = unemp_df.loc[unemp_df['title'].str.contains('Unemployment Rate')]

# get unemployment rates for all ids and concatonate them in one dataframe
all_results = []

for myid in unemp_df.index:
    results = fred.get_series(myid)
    results = results.to_frame(name=myid)
    all_results.append(results)
    time.sleep(2.2) # Don't request to fast and get blocked
uemp_results = pd.concat(all_results, axis=1)

# drop non relevant columns
cols_to_drop = []
for i in uemp_results:
    if len(i) > 4:
        cols_to_drop.append(i)
uemp_results = uemp_results.drop(columns = cols_to_drop, axis=1)

# create new dataframe (uemp_states) and drop NANs. Also replace 
uemp_states = uemp_results.copy()  #.drop('UNRATE', axis=1)
uemp_states = uemp_states.dropna()

# Mapping id to state name by removing verbose text "Unemployment Rate in " in the title's column
id_to_state = unemp_df['title'].str.replace('Unemployment Rate in ','').to_dict()

# list comprehension to rename column names using id_to_state dictionary with mapped state names for each id 
uemp_states.columns = [id_to_state[c] for c in uemp_states.columns]
```
Here's the breakdown of the unemployment rate in the US job market from 1976 to 2024:
- **Wide Unemployment Range:** Unemployment rate ranges from 1.7% to 24.7% during that period, with an average of 5.9% over all states.
- **Corona Peak:** The Covid19 pandemic hit the job market badly, demonstrated by a sharpe unemployment rate increase over all states, slightly moving back to pre-pandemic times in early 2022.
- **Outlier State:** Puerto Rico shows the highest unemployment ratem however, the state's rate seemed to converge to peer states during since the 2020's.

Average US Unemployment Rate (1976 - 2024)
| State               | Unemployment Rate (%) |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Puerto Rico         | 14.19375              |
| West Virginia       | 7.863715              |
| Alaska              | 7.639236              |
| Michigan            | 7.62934               |
| District Of Columbia| 7.463542              |
| ...                 | ...                   |
| Vermont             | 4.427257              |
| New Hampshire       | 4.156771              |
| North Dakota        | 3.682292              |
| South Dakota        | 3.544965              |
| Nebraska            | 3.399306              |

### 2. February 2024 Unemployment Rate 
To understand the current (February 2024) unemployment rate in the US, I ploted a bar chart for all states and sorted the values, providing insights into which state exhibits the highest/lowest unemployment rate in the US.

```python
ax = uemp_states.loc[uemp_states.index == '2024-02-01'].T \
    .sort_values('2024-02-01') \
    .plot(kind='barh', figsize=(8, 12), width=0.7, edgecolor='black',
          title='Unemployment Rate by State, February 2024')
ax.legend().remove()
ax.set_xlabel('% Unemployed')
plt.savefig('uemp_rates_states_feb_2024.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

Here's the breakdown of the February's 2024 unemployment rate per state:
- **Puerto Rico Again** Although converging to peer state's unemployment rate, Puerto Rico still shows the highest rate (5.7%) among all states.
- **Lowest Rate** North (2.0%) and South Dakota (2.1%) have the lowest unemployment rates.

### 3. Comparison w/ Participation Rate

This comparison helped understand the participation rate against the unemployment rate per State since 2020, indicating effective job integration measures.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(10, 5, figsize=(30, 30), sharex=True)
axs = axs.flatten()

i = 0
for state in uemp_states.columns:
    if state in ["District Of Columbia","Puerto Rico"]:
        continue
    ax2 = axs[i].twinx()
    uemp_states.query('index >= 2020 and index < 2023')[state] \
        .plot(ax=axs[i], label='Unemployment')
    part_states.query('index >= 2020 and index < 2023')[state] \
        .plot(ax=ax2, label='Participation', color=color_pal[1])
    ax2.grid(False)
    axs[i].set_title(state)
    i += 1
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('unemp_vs_part.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```
Here's the breakdown of the unemployment and participation rate in the US since 2020:
- **Heterogeneity:** Some states (e.g., Wisconsin) show converging (e.g., New York) rates, while some other states have diverging rates.
- **Homogeneity:** However, we observe also some states that have congruent unemployment and participation rates, such as New Hampshire.

# Conclusions

### Insights
The comprehensive analysis of the US job market from 1976 to 2024 highlights significant trends and outliers in unemployment rates across various states, offering a nuanced understanding of the labor market's dynamics over nearly five decades. Here are the main findings summarized:
- **Unemployment Range:** US unemployment rates varied widely from 1.7% to 24.7%, averaging 5.9%, reflecting economic fluctuations and the impact of various events on job markets.
- **Covid-19 Impact:** The pandemic caused a notable spike in unemployment, termed the **"Corona Peak,"** with a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels by early 2022.
- **Puerto Rico's Outlier Status:** Historically high unemployment rates in Puerto Rico began to align more with other states in the 2020s.
- **February 2024 Update:** Puerto Rico's unemployment rate was still high at 5.7%, while North and South Dakota reported the lowest rates (2.0% and 2.1%).
- **Unemployment vs. Participation Dynamics:** Since 2020, variations in unemployment and participation rates across states highlighted diverse economic recovery patterns.
- **Regional Economic Insights:** Analysis of state-specific data revealed varying patterns in unemployment and participation rates, suggesting different local economic and policy impacts.


This analysis offers critical insights into the resilience and challenges of the US job market, highlighting the importance of tailored policy interventions to address regional disparities and support a sustainable economic recovery across all states.

### Closing Thoughts
